INT. ABANDONED HOUSE - NIGHT

SHYAM and CHINKI, two curious children, huddle together, flashlights trembling in their hands. Shadows loom as they explore the dusty, eerie rooms. Suddenly, a floorboard creaks loudly. CHINKI gasps, clutching SHYAM's arm. They freeze, listening. A soft whisper drifts from upstairs. Eyes wide, they nod, silently agreeing to investigate, hearts pounding with excitement and fear.

FADE OUT.
