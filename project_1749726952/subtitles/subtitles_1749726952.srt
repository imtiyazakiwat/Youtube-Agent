00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,250
INT.

2
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:04,500
ABANDONED HOUSE - NIGHT

SHYAM and CHINKI, two curious children, huddle together, flashlights trembling in their hands.

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,750
Shadows loom as they explore the dusty, eerie rooms.

4
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:08,000
Suddenly, a floorboard creaks loudly.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,250
CHINKI gasps, clutching SHYAM's arm.

6
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:10,000
They freeze, listening.

7
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,500
A soft whisper drifts from upstairs.

8
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:15,000
Eyes wide, they nod, silently agreeing to investigate, hearts pounding with excitement and fear.

9
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:15,500
FADE OUT.
