Title: "Echoes of War"

Scene: A battlefield, sunrise. A soldier stands amid ruins, holding a tattered flag. Distant explosions echo. He looks down at a photo of his family, then up, determined, towards the horizon.

Voiceover: "In the face of chaos, humanity's spirit burns brightest."

Fade to black. Text: "Remember the past, build the future."
